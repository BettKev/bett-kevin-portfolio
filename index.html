                Full Stack Developer
            </h2>
            <p>Welcome to my digital portfolio! I'm Kevin Bett and this is my avatar. I'm an IT enthusiast with a passion for leveraging technology to create innovative 
                solutions. My journey began with a strong foundation in data entry and computer studies, which quickly evolved into a deep 
                interest in artificial intelligence and web development. Over the years, I've honed my skills in front-end development, 
                crafting intuitive and visually captivating user experiences.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I'm diving deeper into the world of full-stack development, where I aim to bridge the gap between front-end 
                elegance and back-end functionality. Whether it's developing interactive websites, integrating AI into everyday applications, 
                or building sustainable tech solutions, I'm always driven by a desire to make an impact. Join me as I continue this 
                exciting journey of learning, creating, and transforming ideas into reality.</p>

                    <h4>Google Teachable Machine</h4>
                    <p>This image recognition model, built using Googleâ€™s Teachable Machine, identifies whether an image contains 
                        a cat or a dog. It was trained with custom-uploaded images of cats and dogs to enhance accuracy. When an 
                        image is uploaded or scanned using inbuilt device camera, the model analyzes it and outputs a confidence percentage, 
                        indicating whether the image is more likely a cat or a dog. The model will be can work on handheld devices as well as 
                        desktop/laptop computers. It can be integrated into a website for easy access and use.

                    <p>
                        This project focuses on creating high-quality music using Udio, a powerful tool for music production. 
                        Through innovative sound design, mixing, and mastering techniques, I aim to produce tracks that resonate 
                        with listeners across various genres. From concept to completion, every step of the production process 
                        is carefully crafted to ensure a polished and professional final product. This project reflects 
                        my passion for music and my commitment to delivering exceptional audio experiences.
